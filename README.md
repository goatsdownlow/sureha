# SureHA 🐾 fork by Goatsdownlow.

This is a work in progress to merge the sureha and surepy projects by benleb:

https://github.com/benleb/sureha
https://github.com/benleb/surepy

Some items from sureha no longer function and the (unpublished) API from surepetcare appears to have changed.


The idea is to merge surepy into sureha to enable it to be edited easily and be updated.

Please note this is benleb's code and the thanks for this integration should go to him. 

There are some changes from the original sureha already:

New Service to add pets to feeder
New Service to remove pets from feeder
New Service to Zero bowls (currently works on 1 bowl only)
